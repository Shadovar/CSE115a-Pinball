Key for first table design:
-A is the launcher area. The ball should start at A, and the launcher should launch from A.
-B is a one-way wall. The ball can go through B from A, but can't go back.
-C is an initial way to get points. The three grey circles are targets with no collision
	that give one point when the ball touches one of them.
-D is the ball. It is correctly proportioned to the size of this table and the sizes
	of all the objects in the table.
-E is the flippers. I figured a triangular shape would be a useful approximation
	for initial testing. They are in their default position in this image, sized
	appropriately compared to the size of the ball and the space between them. For
	the purposes of initial testing, it might be advantageous to make them bigger.
	If a more traditional flipper shape is actually easier than a triangle, then
	we'll make it like that.
-F is the lost ball space. If the ball goes there, reset it to the launcher.
