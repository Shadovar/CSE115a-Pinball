Installation Instructions:
The folder Final Build contains everything needed to run the game. Just in case, the items needed are:
1) MonoBleedingEdge (folder)
2) Pinball 2d_Data (folder)
3) Pinball 2d.exe
4) UnityCrashHandler32.exe (might not technically be required, but certainly doesn't hurt)
5) UnityPlayer.dll
All of these items must be in the same folder, all next to each other (not inside of any nested folders).
Upon execution, the game will create a file called score.txt. This is where your high score is kept;
you can delete it if you like to reset your high score.

To launch the game, simply run Pinball 2d.exe and the game should open and run.
