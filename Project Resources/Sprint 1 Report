Sprint 1 Report
Actions to Stop Doing:
	Tardiness: While it has not been much of an issue up to this point, ideally
        the few instances of tardiness that have occurred will ideally be the
        last ones, barring extenuating circumstances.
	Otherwise, the team is satisfied with current behavior due to no major issues
        arising during the 3 meetings and minimal work that occurred over the
        course of this sprint.

Actions to Start Doing:
	Whiteboard: The group plans on making use of a whiteboard in one of the CSE
        115a allocated rooms (which one TBD) in order to keep track of current
        Sprint progress in a more tactile and visually informative manner.
	Version Control: Carl (likely to be changed to Scrum Master) will be responsible
        for controlling the Git Repository and the master copy of the game. Updates
        with individuals’ code will be made at weekly meetings. This is an attempt
        to deal with the rampant metadata produced by Unity.

Actions to Keep Doing:
	Meetings: Hold three weekly meetings, Mondays from 11am-12pm in BSoE 340,
    Wednesdays from 4pm-5pm in BSoE 302, and Thursdays from 4:15pm-5:15pm in BSoE 302.

Work Completed:
	Spike: C# vs C++ - C# and Unity chosen.
	Gravity – Completed
	Momentum – Completed
	Friction – Completed
	Collision – Completed
	Graphics – Completed
	Not Completed: N/A


Work Completion Rate:
	Due to the Sprint being completed over the course of a week, and the decision to
        use C# and Unity allowing for premade physics and graphics, the rates are not
        representative.
        
	Days During Sprint: 5
	User Stories Completed: 5/5
	Story Points Completed: 15/15
	Ideal Working Hours: 7
	Actual Working Hours: 5
	Ideal Working Hours/ day: 1.4
