Done:
-Pushed successfully to GitHub
-Downloaded by others.
-Inspected and run successfully by other person(s).
-Manually tested for functionality.
-All non-Unity created functions (Eg Update is Unity created) need documentation
	in standard C# tripple-slash comment above function.

Acceptance:
-Approved by jacob.
-All features are merged into a single scene.
-Any feature interacts properly with ALL other features.
	Eg: Flippers launch the ball, which provides score when a target is hit.
	Some features may not interact with other features, which is accpetable.
-Performance is acceptable. (Frame rate above 24, less than 2GB memory usage)
-User input/output does not overlap other features. (Eg: space cannot both pause and 	launch 	the ball, graphics elements don't overlap)
-Feature only does what it's supposed to do. Any extra things for debugging, etc
	must not be detectable to the user. Any standard logging must go to Debug.Log,
	or log to a file.
