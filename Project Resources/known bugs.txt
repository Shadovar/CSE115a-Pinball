It is possible to re-launch the ball after it has been launched, but before the ball passes through the "gate" (the red barrier at top of launcher region) barrier.
This cannot provide any game-abuse or exploit mechanism and is only an odd effect.

If a flipper is held up, and the ball becomes stuck between the flipper and the red triangle, the ball will repeatedly shake / bounce between
these two things, causing the score to perpetually increase.This can be used as an exploit to gain score.

The left & right tilt functionality works even if the game is paused. The ball will react to the tile,
and continue to move around in an extremely "floaty" state. This can potentially be used as an exploit to gain score.

If the game is paused while the launcher (space) is being held down, the game will continue to operate with the ball having an extremely "floaty" effect.
This can potentially be used as an exploit to gain score.

It is possibly to put false values in the score file. The file is unencrypted, so anything can be changed. This can allow the user to create fake score values,
or even corrupt the file (invalid username, invalid score value, etc), causing all scores to fail to load (the game will still run and log these error, just with undefined behavior).
